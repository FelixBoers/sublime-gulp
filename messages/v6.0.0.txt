Hello!

Killing tasks has been revamped!

## New command

Now you can kill a specific long running task!

Using the command `Gulp: Kill specific running task` will display all the long running tasks that Sublime is tracking on the command pallete, choosing one of them will kill it. It also serves as a "Tasks currently running" list.

## Tracking long running tasks

Until now the package kept track of tasks in memory, meaning that if you ran a long running task like `gulp watch` and restarted Sublime Text, the process wouldn't necessarily die but you couldn't kill it from the editor anymore.

Well not anymore (I hope)!

The package now can keep track of long running tasks using an internal file. So even if you close your editor and re-open it, you should still be able to list and kill running tasks.
Depending on the OS you're on, the process might die anyways without the package interverting. Sublime Gulp tries to remedy this by checking if the process is still alive before listing it.

In case you don't want Sublime writing the long running processes pids you can disable it on the settings, setting `track_processes` to false which will revert back to in-memory tracking. And you can still use `Gulp: Exit editor killing running tasks` if you want a "clean" exit.


Thanks a lot to @kikandrew for kickstarting this.

That is all!
