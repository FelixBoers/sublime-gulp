Hello!

New command!, now you can kill a specific long running task.

Using the command `Gulp: Kill specific running task` will display all the long running tasks that Sublime is tracking on the command pallete, choosing one of them will kill it. 

Also, the package now prints the path that created the task when killed, useful if you're running multiple `gulp`s on different projects.


Thanks a lot to @kikandrew for kickstarting this.

That is all!
As always if you have any issues or feature requests go to https://github.com/NicoSantangelo/sublime-gulp/issues

Thanks!
