Hello!

New command!, if you forget to kill your running tasks before exiting Sublime Text, now you can use `gulp_exit`.


This command will close Sublime Text, but first it'll kill any running tasks. It's the same as running `Gulp: Kill running tasks` and immediately exiting the editor.

`Gulp exit` will not appear on the command palette. To use it, you need to add a keybinding like this:

    { "keys": ["KEYS"], "command": "gulp_exit" }

If you want to always run it, you can bind it to `alt+f4` or `super+q`. Sadly it won't run if you close the editor using the close button and Sublime doesn't provide a callback for that.


Thanks to @dirad for the idea.
